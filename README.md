Optimizing Supply Chain Using Shipment Pricing Data
Project Overview

This project analyzes global shipment pricing data to uncover cost drivers and optimize logistics strategies. Using real-world USAID SCMS delivery data (10,324 records), the goal is to improve forecasting accuracy, identify expensive shipment routes, and recommend cost-efficient transportation and supplier strategies.
